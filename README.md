webos-homebrew-channel
======================

Features
--------

* Independent webOS package repository
    * Homebrew discovery, installation & updates
* Support for multiple repositories (outside of official
  [repo.webosbrew.org](https://repo.webosbrew.org)

* (root) Root execution service that can be easily used by webOS homebrew
  developers without a need of separate privilege escalation handling (`luna://org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/exec`)
* (root) Disable some telemetry
* (root) Startup user hooks (executable scripts present in `/var/lib/webosbrew/init.d` are run on bootup)
* (root) Remote access
    * SSH - public key authenticated (with default `alpine` password until
      authorized keys are provisioned)
    * Telnet - unauthenticated, use sparingly
* (root) Failsafe mode
    * In case a device crashes on boot only an emergency shell will be exposed
      via telnet. In order to disable it fix the original crash cause and remove
      `/var/luna/preferences/webosbrew_failsafe` flag file.

Installation
------------
## Automated (recommended)
Latest Homebrew Channel version is automatically installed when rooting a TV
with https://rootmy.tv exploit.

## Automated
Execute the following snippet on target TV using SSH or Telnet:
```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel/main/tools/install.sh | sh -

# Update startup script (assuming running as root)
cp /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/startup.sh /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/services/com.palmdts.devmode.service/start-devmode.sh
```

## Manual
* Download [latest release
  `.ipk`](https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel/releases/)
* Install it using `ares-install` SDK command or using the following command
  directly on a TV:
  ```sh
  luna-send-pub -i 'luna://com.webos.appInstallService/dev/install' '{"id":"com.ares.defaultName","ipkUrl":"/tmp/path/to/hbchannel.ipk","subscribe":true}'`
  ```
* (root) Elevate privileges by running:
  ```sh
  /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/elevate-service
  ```
* (root) Update startup script:
  ```sh
  cp /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/startup.sh /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/services/com.palmdts.devmode.service/start-devmode.sh
  ```

Interfaces
----------

This application exposes a Luna service that may be used by other homebrew
applications on Rooted devices:

### `luna://org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/install`
Download, verify and install an application.

        * `closeCode` [number] - exit code
    * `exit` - child proess ended
        * `exitCode` [number] - exit code

### `luna://org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/getAppInfo`
`luna://com.webos.applicationManager/getAppInfo` call replicated using
devmode-only endpoints.

## Repository management

webOS application (or remote device, via SSAP) may request Homebrew Launcher to
add an external repository, by launching it with the following launch params:

```json
{
    "launchMode": "addRepository",
    "url": "https://url-to-repository.com"
}
```

This will automatically jump to Settings view and open up "Add repository"
prompt with URL filled in.

This can be tested by using `ares-launch` as follows:
```sh
ares-launch org.webosbrew.hbchannel -p '{"launchMode":"addRepository","url":"https://google.com"}'
```

Development
-----------

### Environment
Some libraries used by this project are submodules of this repository. Use
following command when cloning:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel
```

All required development packages are distributed via npm. In order to install
them in a local directory run:
```sh
npm install
```

### Technology stack
Frontend is based on last development version of [enyo](https://github.com/enyojs).
(dated january 2017) While this definitely is not the cool and jazzy latest
technology, it provides us with a sensible UI toolkit for TV-based application
that seems to work pretty well with versions of webOS as old as 1.x. We are
currently using enyo built-in `enyo-dev` packager. This requires us to write
code that'll be run directly on target platforms (no babel/transpilation of newer
ES dialects - no arrow functions, no const, no promises, etc.). In the future
we may migrate to some webpack-based solution around that.

Service is packaged using webpack & babel, thus, with enough shims and patches,
we can write and use some modern ES features (like Promises, arrow functions,
async functions, const, etc.) while targeting NodeJS 0.10 (used on earliest
webOS versions)

### Development TV setup

#### Configuring @webosose/ares-cli with Developer Mode App
This is partially based on: https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/app-test/using-devmode-app/
* Install Developer Mode app from Content Store
* Enable developer mode, enable keyserver
* Download TV's private key: `http://TV_IP:9991/webos_rsa`
* Configure the device using `ares-setup-device` (`-a` may need to be replaced with `-m` if device named `webos` is already configured)
  * `PASSPHRASE` is the 6-character passphrase printed on screen in developer mode app
```sh
ares-setup-device -a webos -i "username=prisoner" -i "privatekey=/path/to/downloaded/webos_rsa" -i "passphrase=PASSPHRASE" -i "host=TV_IP" -i "port=9922"
```

#### Configuring @webosose/ares-cli with rooted TV
* Enable sshd in Homebrew Channel app
* Generate ssh key on developer machine (`ssh-keygen`)
* Copy the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to `/home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on TV
* Configure the device using `ares-setup-device` (`-a` may need to be replaced with `-m` if device named `webos` is already configured)
```sh
ares-setup-device -a webos -i "username=root" -i "privatekey=/path/to/id_rsa" -i "passphrase=SSH_KEY_PASSPHRASE" -i "host=TV_IP" -i "port=22"
```

**Note:** @webosose/ares-cli doesn't need to be installed globally - you can use a package installed locally after `npm install` in this repo by just prefixing above commands with local path, like so: `node_modules/.bin/ares-setup-device ...`

### Frontend development
EnyoJS is able to watch for frontend changes, but does not expose a HTTP server.

```sh
npm run build -- --watch

# ...in a separate terminal:
python -m http.server -d dist/
```

### Production build
```sh
rm -rf dist && npm run build -- --production && npm run build-service -- --env production && npm run package
```

### Full application testing / deployment
```sh
rm -rf dist && npm run build && npm run build-service && npm run package && npm run deploy && npm run launch
ssh root@10.0.0.2 -p 9922 /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/elevate-service
```

### Service testing
```sh
npm run build-service && \
    cat dist/services/service.js | ssh root@10.0.0.2 -p 9922 sh -c 'cat > /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/service.js && pkill -f org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service'
ssh root@10.0.0.2 -p 9922 /usr/bin/run-js-service -k -n /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service
```

### Update start-devmode.sh script
```sh
cp /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/startup.sh /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/services/com.palmdts.devmode.service/start-devmode.sh
```

### Release engineering
```sh
npm version minor
git push origin main --tags
```
